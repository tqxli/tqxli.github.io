Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University, advised by Dr. [Timothy Dunn](https://www.tdunnlab.org/). My research has focused on building computer vision tools that **measure how lab animals move, quantitatively and precisely in 3D**, together with data-driven frameworks that efficiently transform behavioral dynamics into informative representations, ultimately in connection with the brain.

Before Duke, I completed my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics and Bioengineering at University of California, Los Angeles. I worked on AI-facilitated medical image analysis at UCLA Medical Informatics advised by Professor [William Hsu](https://mii.ucla.edu/people/william-hsu-phd), mainly upon CT scan denoising and breast lesion detection in ultrasound.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading mystery and detective fiction. Some of my favorites are *The Seventh Hypothesis* by Paul Halter, *The Tokyo Zodiac Murders* and *The Knight Stranger* by Soji Shimada. 

**Research Interests**
- 3D motion capture in unconstrained social rodents
- unsupervised behavioral/motion representation learning
- social phenotyping of neuropsychiatric diseases (autism)
- deep learning for computational neuroscience & ethology
